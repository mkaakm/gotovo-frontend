In the subconscious of the average citizen, a government agency is a gloomy building with Soviet-era renovations, with many corridors and offices where rude officials sit."

There, almost all documents and certificates of the state standards and several hundred other administrative services can be obtained within the walls of one institution, where the average speed of service is 15 minutes. We took this Georgian experience as a basis and created a Ukrainian project."
